My Java code borrows heavily and shamelessly from the [jna-gmp project on GitHub](https://github.com/square/jna-gmp). I cleaned it up a bit to make it more obvious how to enable additional functionality, and added more useful functions for integer arithmetic that are commonly used in cryptography.

Using my code on a Linux system is easy, as compiling libgmp is pretty straightforward. However, I ran into issues when trying to compile the library on Windows using Cygwin. Here I describe the process of compiling and using libgmp within Java on a Windows platform.
